# 📊 Mental Health Analysis with Machine Learning

## 📝 Project Overview
This project aims to analyze mental health trends using machine learning techniques. We perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and build predictive models such as Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Linear Regression to uncover insights from behavioral features.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Name:** Mental Health Dataset
- **Features:** Behavioral attributes related to mental health
- **Objective:** Identify key patterns and predict mental health outcomes

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python 🐍
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab** for analysis

## 📈 Features
✔️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 📊  
✔️ Data Preprocessing and Cleaning 🧹  
✔️ Visualization and Statistical Insights 📉  
✔️ Machine Learning Models (DT, KNN, Linear Regression) 🤖  
✔️ Model Evaluation and Interpretation 🎯  

## 🚀 Getting Started
### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
